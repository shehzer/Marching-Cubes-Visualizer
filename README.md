# Marching-Cubes-Visualizer

This project focuses on generating triangle meshes using the marching cubes algorithm and implementing non-trivial shaders in OpenGL. The program allows users to manipulate the view matrix to simulate object rotation around the origin and saves the resulting mesh to a PLY file.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository or download the necessary files.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (OpenGL, GLFW).
3. Run the provided Python script to execute the marching cubes algorithm, render the result, and save the resulting mesh to a PLY file.

## How to Run

1. Install the required libraries using the following command (if you haven't already):

```bash
pip install glfw PyOpenGL
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python marching_cubes.py
```

## Camera and View Matrix

1. The program allows you to "click and drag" the object to simulate spinning around the origin. This effect is implemented using camera movement, specifically spherical coordinates.
2. A limited "first-person camera" approach is used, where you control the camera as if you were in the world. Camera position is specified relative to the world origin using three parameters: 𝑟, 𝜃, 𝜙. Horizontal motion modifies 𝜃, and vertical motion modifies 𝜙.
3. Arrow keys are used to modify 𝑟. The up arrow key decreases 𝑟, moving the camera closer to the origin, and the down arrow key increases 𝑟, moving the camera further from the origin. The initial camera position is (5, 5, 5), looking at (0, 0, 0).

## Marching Cubes

The program implements the marching cubes algorithm on an arbitrary scalar field. The marching cubes function takes a scalar field function, an isovalue, minimum and maximum values for the grid, and a step size. It returns a list of floats representing the 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 positions of the generated vertices.

## Normal Computation and Writing PLY

1. The program implements a function `compute_normals` that computes normal vectors for each vertex in the marching cubes' output. The normal vectors are normalized and specified in counter-clockwise winding order.
2. A function `writePLY` is provided, which creates a PLY file and writes the vertices and normals to it. Each face is declared by three unique vertices, without sharing vertices between faces.

## Rendering and Shaders

1. The program draws a box around the marching volume, representing the cube with corners (min, min, min) and (max, max, max). Only the edges of this box are drawn.
2. Three coordinate axes corresponding to positive x, y, and z directions are drawn, starting at (min, min, min) and having a length of max - min.
3. Vertex positions and normals are stored in VBOs, and a VAO is used alongside `glDrawArrays` to draw the triangles generated by marching cubes.
4. The marching cubes triangles are drawn using a Phong-like shader, incorporating lighting, ambient, diffuse, and specular colors. The vertex shader computes the required vectors for interpolation, while the fragment shader calculates the combination of ambient, diffuse, and specular colors based on the light source direction.
